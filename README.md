# Sort-Array-of-Integers
A program that sorts an array of 16 2's complement integers.

LC-3 is an educational assembly language.

LC-3 ISA: Address space of 2^16, 8 general purpose registers, [15 instructions](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~patt/19f.306/Handouts/LC3_Instruction_Set.pdf), 2's complement integer data type, 5 addressing modes.



Instructions to download the LC3 simulator can be found on [Professor Yale Patt's website](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~patt/19f.306/software.html).

sort.asm is an assembly implementation of the bubble sorting algorithm. The program sorts an array of 16 2's complement integers that starts at x32F0 in memory and ends at x32FF in memory. It does not matter if the integers are positive, negative, or zero.
